(My) MiniLisp
=============

Welcome to my custom version of the "minilisp" repository!

This is where I tinker and play with my own spin on the [original "minilisp" project](https://github.com/rui314/minilisp).
While I'm inspired by the original, I'm adding my personal touch to make it uniquely mine.
Think of this repository as my coding sandbox where I have fun exploring.
